Sample project: example usage of javassist api methods 
===========
We parse an xml and create a hierarchy of beans and delegate an invocation further down the bean chain before executing method body. 

@Trace annotation adds a System.out call before method invocation
@Mute annotation supresses all System.out calls in the method it's declared on. 

Main class is a main class :)
